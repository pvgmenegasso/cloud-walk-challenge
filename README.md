Challenge for CloudWalk's interview











### Software Engineer - Technical Assignment

Hello candidate,

This is the **technical assignment** for the **Software Engineer** position on the R&D team in CloudWalk, Inc.

In this technical assignment we want to identify the following abilities:
- Ability of **solving problems**
- Ability of creating **scalable and optimized solutions**
- Know how to design a solution **architecture** in the **Cloud**
- Do a **clean and legible code**
- Use **Software Engineering and DevOps best practices**

We are going to give you **2 options** about how to do this step:
- The first one is: **We are going to propose a problem and you should expose a solution**
- The second option is: **Choose a problem in the Software Engineering area** that you believe is challenging, expose the problem and propose a solution. It can be a solution that you already worked on or a solution that you never tested but you think it interesting - the only requirement is that this problem is challenging and different for you.

To show the solution, **you can choose the way you believe that is best to show your own abilities and defend your solution**. It means that the solution can be show as a code, power point, a video, an image of a diagram, a report, etc. Also, remember to send your solution in **english**.

We **strongly recommend** that you do some code so we can know if you know how to program and create a clean and legible code, but any kind of file is valid (and you can send more than 1 type of file), since it shows your abilities and you defend your solution.

## If you choose the first option,

Your challenge is to **answer InfinitePay's clients automatically in the chat in a proper way to solve the client problem**.

You have access to systems in the form of APIs in whih you can check client's problems and the needed information to solve them.

Check what chats are opened/active, and, for each chat, check what is the client's complaints. Using the APIs and database tables that are available, show us how you would build a software to automatically answer the client in a proper way.
Consider that instead of a SQLite Database (it's attached to this email), it's a PostgreSQL deployed in a GCP Cloud SQL. The APIs you have access were deployed on App Engine.

Remember that the solution needs to be **scalable in case both the number of chats and the number of potential problems a customer may have increase (in which case it should be easy to patch the automatic solution to a frictionless new problem)**.

If you have any doubt, get in touch by sending an email to `ana.tamais@cloudwalk.io`. **Good questions will be counted positively for this hiring process**.

Lastly, **we already solved this problem internally** and we don't want you to think that you are working for free. If your solution is better than ours, (and you have a cultural fit with us) we will try to hire you.

#### APIs you have access to

You have access to 3 APIs:
- The first one is a **logistics** API (think of this API as a FEDEX API) - `https://logistics-api-dot-active-thunder-329100.rj.r.appspot.com`. In this API, you will have 2 endpoints:
   - `[POST] /tracking`: This endpoint is useful to **track a delivery**. You give a body as input in the following format:
   
          {"id_sale": "123456"}
          
      And receives as a response: 
                        
          {"id": "123456",
          "status": "On delivery route",
          "delivery_forecast": "01/12/2021",
          "destination_zip_code": "31160550"}
          
        In practice, this endpoint is useful to track the delivery of InfinitePay's credit card machines.

   - `[POST] /zip_code`: This endpoint is useful to, given your ZIP code, give the **complete address** as the response. You should give a body as input in the following format:
                 
          {"zip_code": "31160550"}
          
      And receives as a response:
                 
          {
            "neighborhood": "Palmares",
            "ZIP_code": "31160-550",
            "city": "Belo Horizonte",
            "complement": "",
            "street": "Rua Professor Patroc√≠nio Filho",
            "state": "MG"
          }
     **Remember to add a header called `authorization` with the value `teste`**
- The second one is a **telecommunications** API (think of this API as an API of a company that sells chips to be used on the credit card machines) - `https://telecom-api-dot-active-thunder-329100.rj.r.appspot.com`. In this API, you will find 1 endpoint:
   - `[POST] /chip_status`: This endpoint is used to check the **chip status**. You give as input the chip id in the following format:
 
          {"chip_id": "CHIP37648"}
          
      And receives as a response:
          
          {
            "id": "CHIP37648",
            "status": "active",
            "description": "OK"
          }
      The possible status are: `active`, `inactive` and `without connection`. In the description key we have the reason of the chip problem, if the status is `inactive` or `without connection`.
      
     **Remember to add a header called `authorization` with the value `teste`**
     
- The third API is the **conversations** API. When an InfinitePay client have any problem with one of our solutions, **they can get in touch with us using our chat**. This API enables that you collect conversations from our chat - `https://chats-api-dot-active-thunder-329100.rj.r.appspot.com`. In this API, we have 2 endpoints:
   - `[POST] /conversations`: This endpoint returns a list of conversation ids, whose conversations are happening in the same time as the request, it means, a **list of the active conversation ids**. You don't need to give a body as input, you will receive as response:
          
          {"conversation_ids": [754893, 754894, 754895, 754896, 754897]}
          
   - `[POST] /conversation_info`: This endpoint returns **conversation information** given a conversation_id. You should give a body in this format:
          
          {"conversation_id": "754893"}

      And receives as a response:
      
          {
           "conversation_id": "754893",
           "messages": [{
                    "message_id": "754893-0",
                    "text": "hello, my money hasn't landed in my bank account yet. I want to know what happened",
                    "created_at": "1640197668"}
                ],
           "merchant_id": "558392",
           "subject": "bank account receipt problem"
          }
      **The field `subject` is generated by an AI that classifies automaticaly the conversation subject.**
      
      The field `merchant_id` is the shopkeeper id (InfinitePay's client id)
      
   - `[POST] /send_message`: This endpoint is used to **send a message** in a conversation. You should give a body in this format:

          {"conversation_id": "754893",
           "message": "test, test"}
           
      And receives as a response:

          {
           "conversation_id": "754893",
           "message": "test, test",
           "sent": "true",
           "decription": "OK"
          }
          
     **Remember to add a header called `authorization` with the value `teste`**
     
Besides the 3 APIs, you also have access to a SQLite Database (it's attached to this email), in which you will find 3 tables:

- `sales`: This table shows the sales data for credit card machines. This sales are from InfinitePay to its clients. As column, we do have:
   - `id_sale`: InfinitePay's sales unique id - it's a sale of credit card machine made by InfinitePay
   - `merchant_id`: shopkeeper unique id (InfinitePay's client)
   - `chip_id`: credit card machine's chip unique id
   - `created_at`: datetime from time of purchase of credit card machine
   - `status`: sale status
   - `description`: status details
- `transactions`: This table shows transaction data which went through InfinitePay's credit card machines (for example: if a supermarket, which is a InfinitePay customer, passes a transaction to sell a chocolate to the final customer, this transaction will be in the transactions table)
   - `transaction_id`: unique id of the transaction that passed on an InfinitePay customer's credit card machine.
   - `merchant_id`: shopkeeper unique id who passed that transaction
   - `created_at`: transaction datetime
   - `value`: transaction value 
- `receipt`: This table shows value transfer data to an InfinitePay customer's bank account arising from transactions made the day before. (Context: When a market, for example, makes a transaction of R$50,00 in credit, the market will only receive in its bank account the money referring to this sale the following day).
   - `merchant_id`: shopkeeper unique id
   - `created_at`: datetime InfinitePay tried to transfer the money to the merchant's account
   - `status`: bank transfer status
   - `description`: status details
   - `value`: value that should be transferred to the shopkeeper. This value must be equal to the sum of transaction's values from the previous day
